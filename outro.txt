and
the

light
that skims the kitchen floor
in a swirl of violet, gold, and bronze.

it matters not
what color it is in the
light
that pierces the darkness out of me.

it matters not
what color it is in my worthier
judgments that lead me astray.

it matters

not how many
pixels it takes to tell the
dark
size of my fist of clay to
drown me of a world
too large for me.

it matters

not how many
pixels of megalomania
that it takes
10 seconds
to scroll through my e-mail
through the use of a megabyte (1,100,000,000,000,000,e-mails) link tracer.

i transmogrify the

light
through layers of glass,
fog, and chemicals.

into the human species.

into the unknown.

into the power of my mind.

into the dangers of my soul.
into the power of my heart
and mind-altering drugs
that lead me insane.

into the many, many
disorders of my mind that I am not.

into the complexities of my thoughts,
arts, poetry, and mathematics
and literature
and culture and all the
comforts
of being a human being.

into the many, many
disorders
of

your choosing,

or

myation.

i am a mind

multiverse of my most
disordered

products.

into the chaos and
contagion that is mind
and space-time.

into

the most
mind-altering substances
in

our bodies
before it is too late.
